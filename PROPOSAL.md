Final Project

I would like to make a game that have a moving ball and breakable/unbreakable walls and a board. I would like to make this game because I find it interesting and relaxing to play. 

By week 1 I would finish the basic class decomposition

By week 2 I would finish my game engine

By week 3 I would finish my whole game.
